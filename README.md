Just walked out of Borderline and my brain’s like static. There’s something about the way the theater lights hit you after two hours in the dark, like waking up from a dream mid-sentence. I think I spilled popcorn on myself?? Anyway, the movie - it’s this disjointed dance of chaos, you know. Like if David Lynch and a hurricane had a film baby. The sounds of the cars and rain just swallowed dialogue like my ears were underwater. And the protagonist... what was her name? Like she could morph into shadows or maybe I’m messing it up with a fever dream I had.

> That scene where she was running - with all those lights stuttering like some old GIF loading on dial-up, had me gripping the seat. And that... was that sweating guy with the briefcase talking to her or through her? I swear, he had the same energy as a cat trying to catch a laser pointer dot. Everything felt like it was shot in a neighbor’s backyard but also the moon? Almost wanted to download the movie immediately after, just to pause every frame and decode it like some cryptic software error.

The sound kept rumbling in the theater, like my stomach used to back in college when I lived off ramen. I think the dude next to me fell asleep because he was breathing like a leaf blower. It kinda synced with the soundtrack, though, all haphazard and swelling when things went gory or poetic.

One scene that's sticking - her reflection didn’t match up in the store window. Freaky stuff. How did they do that without CGI overload? Felt like watching a string of unordered code run perfectly - like, 3% of the time. Reminds me, someone asked me to watch the movie asap but did I text back or did I dream that too?

This ache in my back's a souvenir from sitting weird---like, imagine the protagonist's emotional baggage shaped a chair. Borderline really gets under your skin sideways, like a vine of electric cables sparking. It’s not a movie you watch; it’s a rollercoaster you download straight into your veins.
